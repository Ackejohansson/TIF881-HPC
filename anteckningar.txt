Föreläsning om String parsing

Slower cause of locality

Faster to take -'0' for each char and multiply with the factor 
then for minus if s[0] == '-' then return -x

could do return (',' - s[0]) * x, which was Faster yeasrs ago. More consise.

mark with () to split work on fpu for example a lots of addition



Use short, convert to float when taking the square. 3 conversions but 3 FLU so done in paralell


Subdivide loops
Use larger blocksizes
