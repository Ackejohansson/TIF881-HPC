Stack vs Heap
The stack memory was around 2 MB or 500 000 ints of size 4 bytes.
Stack faster, heap larger

Memory fragmentation
- Alloctaion efficiency (space between, many small gaps -> harder to allocate larger)
- Performance (less overhead)
Less flexible however (requires larger contigous space)

fprintf vs fwrite
fprintf much slower due to formating
save in variable then in file

Benchmarking, flags
-O 0-3 optimizes the code. 
The higher number the more agressive optimization -> larger exe files
O2 optimizes loops -> large improvements!
